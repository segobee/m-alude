          </div>
            <p>..............................................................................................................</p>
            <h3>The Beginning of a Long Journey</h3>
            <p>A casual tea sharing with a friend jolted into gisting about my transition to tech. I always find 
            comfort reminiscing on the back story of my Machine Learning journey.</p>
            <p> </p>
          <div class="col-xs-12 col-md-11">
            <img src="./assets/images/tea-conv.png" class="img-responsive" alt="">
            <p>Beginning of the conversation</p>
          </div>
          <p>Transitioning was cloudy! The bright side of the action I was about to take was kidnapped, or perhaps missing 
            with no existence. The tunnel’s light was severely hazy. I felt so at ease in my own space. However, 
            my long throat and appetite for challenging task and career refined my crude comfort.</p>
          <p>My world view about life makes me understand that:</p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>"Peace without challenge will result in chaos of mind, and mind without vision will ply road with 
              so many portholes that will hinder it to get to the destination; though the road to destination is 
              not always smooth."</p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>All these jealously guarded my story. Story aided with enormous questioning. One of such, questioned, 
            how I could make a smooth transition, given that I had previously collaborated closely with those who I 
            would soon be competing with in building with keypads resulting to deep-thinking and solution-driven 
            products. Then comes the unruly prophet of doom and gloom, questioning the number of years of the people 
            in the game. However, my fate in blooming years ahead where I would be part of team(s) that will develop 
            products that would serve as industry standards for solving specific problems and spur industry growth 
            dissuaded that thought.</p>
          <p>Mind was made, plans were drawn, and actions were taken. Found myself in the pool of programming and 
            data. The thrilling part is how data solve problems and bring about growth (which is my core strength). 
            The intelligence from data, being the pathfinder for growth, will captain the innovation process to the 
            execution stage garnishing the road to victory, accompany by clear vision.</p>
          <p><b>Into our conversation, now my guy asked:</b></p>
          <p><b><em>“How did I make it to this point, learning the guiding principles of Machine Learning?”</em></b></p>
          <p>To me, answering this question will take me on a journey. I decided to make it succinct by painting an 
            illustration picture. I began the periphery of the story with:</p>
          <p><em>(Note: this is sequel to the cumulative build-up story)</em></p>
          <div class="col-xs-12 col-md-12">

          </div>
          <blockquote>
            <p>"To every house owner, each one at one point had the picture design of the house they wanted to 
              build in their minds depending on the resources available to them."</p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>This was my case of learning Machine Learning. The picture design of my house was Machine Learning.</p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>"To every high-rise buildings and skyscrapers, foundation is the bedrock. The quality of the soil, 
              the area, structural planning etc, determine how high a building can go."</p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>In my own case, I don’t know how high my building would go (thus, it’s lifelong learning journey). So, 
            I decided to have a rock solid foundation.</p>
          <p>Got a land <em>(conceptualized the idea to learn Machine Learning)</em>. Proceeded to check the structural 
            planning <em>(formulated my machine learning road map)</em>. Did a forensic analysis on the area that host the 
            land which will invariably host the building <em>(mapped out the tools needed to be learned before I can 
            start building Machine Learning solutions)</em>. Tested the quality of the soil <em>(deciding the germane tools 
            in building Machine Learning)</em>, and some other back-end processes that needed to be followed.</p>
          <p>The process began in earnest. The materials for the rock-solid foundation of my building started 
            converging at the site. The likes of:</p>

                <p>.</p>

                <p>.</p>
                <p>With the rock-solid foundation secured, I sorted help from a contractor <b>(Hamoye)</b>, who at the time was 
                  on a mission to build lasting skyscrapers from the ground up (training 21st-century Data Scientists 
                  through a rigorous process in solving different industry problems with the inclination for growth).</p>
                <p>After <b>Hamoye</b> boarded as the contractor, the building processes began in smooth sailing. They started building 
                  from the ground floor leveraging on the already secured materials<b>(Python, SQL, Pandas, Numpy, Tableau, etc.)</b>. 
                  They designed a four-storey building;</p>

                        </ul>
                      </div>
                <p>Each floor designed by <b>Hamoye</b> was subsequently evaluated (attached each learning path with a project) 
                  together with assessment scores 
                  <a href="https://github.com/segobee/Hamoye-Data-Science-" title="" class="btn btn-default">Github Repo</a>.
                  After the evaluation processes, there was team collaboration, 
                  testing the designs if they met initial structural planning of the building (Capstone Projects in team collaboration).
                  After the contractual timing of the project elapsed, <b>Hamoye</b> hung their boot after building such a glorious edifice 
                  of 4-storey building. <b><em>My learning with Hamoye concluded here…</em></b></p>
                <p>I know you would be wondering if that was the end of the building processes. Did I stop my ML learning journey? 
                  That’s a question that begs for an answer. But remember, I said earlier that this journey is a life-long journey.</p>

                <p>.</p>
                <p>One cannot overemphasize the importance of a building of that magnificent to stand the test of time.
                  On this backdrop, it birthed a decision. A decision to comprehensively audit the building constructed 
                  by <b>Hamoye</b> (i.e., checking my ML journey through Hamoye and my learning curve if I needed to step back 
                  and build on some additional skills that would serve as an armored vehicle paving way for my career 
                  progression in <b>Machine Learning</b>).</p>
                <p>It will interest you to know that this comprehensive audit led to some hidden discoveries. One of 
                  such discovery birthed the need for an interior designer <b>(ALX-T)</b>. The mandate of this interior designer 
                  is to complement the work that has already been executed by Hamoye and make the building stand strong.</p>
                <p><b>IN MACHINE LEARNING TERM</b></p>
                <p><b>"The audit opened pool of discoveries. I understood that on rare occasion as ML expert, clean data is not a given. 
                  Communication of your findings (insights) through visualization is germane. Then reporting the processes and decisions
                  made while analysing the data is crucial to the problem goal. The discoveries led me to know that some initial acquired
                  skills needed fine-tuning. Data wrangling and visualization seem next shop on my list of ML shopping spree. Who is
                  best suited to undertake this assignment was the question that came to my mind."</b></p>
                <p><b>"ALX-T lend a hand with their sponsored program through Udacity. This program captured the shortcomings
                  of the previously attained feat. It chronicles into the life processes of Data Wrangling, Visualization, and Reporting. 
                  It patches the obvious holes from the earlier program (Hamoye ML). It gives life to data preparation and cleaning where 
                  data provided or acquired tend to be dirty. Dutiful bound Model lagged on these intrinsic skills to be able to have 
                  predictive power and solve business problem."</b></p>
                <p>Encapsulation of the above skills solidifies the building structure <b>(ML processes)</b>. It gives a smooth cruise to 
                  level-up on the building</p>

                <h3>Infrastructural Warehouse</h3>
                <p>What happens now that all the processes have been completed and the necessary skills have been acquired?</p>
                <p>Looking back, we have a standing structure already (acquired skills needed in building business-focused and problem-solving 
                  models), what we need more is to elevate the status of the structure.</p>
                <p><b>Let's go back to the factory settings and resume the narration from where we left off.</b></p>
                <p>A high-rise building (four-storey) has been erected, and palliative work has also been done to solidify its base. 
                  Building a 21st-century high-rise building is a departure from the old order. Its perspectives and designs are not 
                  always conventional, but rather a healthy reworking of the entire process. We’ve reached a point where we need to 
                  ensure the building follows through with the modern template. In doing so, we hope to wrap the entire structure in 
                  an infrastructure that will ensure its stability in the face of future occurrences and changes.</p>
                <p><b>IN MACHINE LEARNING TERMS</b></p>
                <p><b>"Capping the entire pipeline of building a machine-learning model from production to execution stage requires a dedicated 
                  infrastructure that’s scalable and cost-efficient in warehousing a deployed model. Many open-source and proprietary 
                  machine-learning systems have long supported any types of predictions in solving business problems. However, the cost of 
                  these systems, in terms of hardware and software, was until recently out of reach for most enterprises."</b></p>
                <p><b>"Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning are making inroads into enterprise applications such as customer 
                  service, fraud detection, and business intelligence. Big bets on democratizing Artificial Intelligence are being 
                  made by all of the leading cloud computing platforms. Microsoft, Amazon, and Google have all made sizable investments 
                  in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning over the past years, from launching new services to carrying 
                  out significant reorganizations that strategically integrate AI into their organizational structures."</b></p>
                <p><b>"It’s imperative to believe that cloud would be the destination for all the machine-learning projects for businesses/companies

                <h3>Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Enters the Journey</h3>
                <p>.</p>
                <div class="col-xs-12 col-md-12">

                </div>
                <p>.</p>
                <p>Understanding the earlier position from the business prism was a pointer to adopt additional materials in my quest to
                  gate-keep skills for modern machine-learning workflow. After the areas of focus have been identified, the area to 
                  dismantle first surfaces naturally. Over the past years, many cloud computing platforms have come upstream. Judging 
                  by recent directions of different businesses after doing their due diligence on the impact of this migration to their 
                  businesses and available resources, Azure by Microsoft, AWS by Amazon, and Google Cloud Platform by Google tend to 
                  be the first call as the big players in the sector. Different businesses adopt any of those according to the impact on 
                  their businesses.</p>
                <p>On my part, learning all would be a long stretch. I had to settle for one. Leaning on the back of Google Cloud Platform (GCP) 
                  wouldn’t be a bad thing for the start, considering their plethora learning materials. So, I adopted Google cloud.</p>
                  <blockquote>
                    <p>"It’s very important to know that the world is filled with data, and it comes from all around us. With Machine Learning, 
                      meaning can be brought to the data regardless of the source, which will invariably helps in answering questions at scale. 
                      Machine Learning application and industries are wide raging. Although, it may not always be apparent, but Machine Learning 
                      is everywhere, from image recognition to text and speech system."</p>
                  </blockquote>
                <p>The courses and materials provided by Google did tremendous justice to Machine Learning workflow in 
                  Google Cloud Platform (GCP). This came on the backdrop of making the Machine Learning tasks better, faster, and 
                  easier. Within its infrastructures, there’s presence of Vertex AI Platform, BigQuery ML, TensorFlow, and Keras.
                  <b>Through the well segmented framework of the courses, the following were comprehended:</b></p>
                  <div class="template-example">

                      </div>
                <p>For me, the offshoot of the above courses soft-pedalled the transition of Machine Learning workflow
                   in Google Cloud Platform. Other cloud computing platforms would come after.</p>
                <p><b>Back to the factory setting:</b> all the palliative works have been achieved with a rock-solid foundation.</p>
                <p>What’s next? Did my learning continue? Did I continue building on the already established foundation? WAIT FOR IT!</p>
                <p>The conversation continues.....</p>
